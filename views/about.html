            <h3>FRAIL</h3>
            <p>
            <strong>FRAIL</strong>, as in 
            <strong>FR</strong>amework for 
            <strong>AI L</strong>aboratories, is an application designed for testing artificial intelligence of game bosses in a
            custom environment made for that purpose.</p>
            <p>FRAIL was originally made as a project for Artificial Intelligence class in Wroclaw University of Technology by
            Andrzej Cwenar and Maciej Kurowski, under the name AI SandBox. Then, decision was made to continue expanding it as an
            finishing project for bachelor of sciences degree. At this point, they were joined by Sebastian Łasisz and Miłosz
            Mazur. A project's supervisor was dr inż. Paweł Myszkowski.</p>
            <p>Today, we aim to continue expanding FRAIL as a complex research tool, to deliver more options, more space, and to
            provide excellent-working and no less looking content. To boldly go where no AI environment has gone before.</p>
            <h3>What you get</h3>
            <p>Our application was originally made for writing you own controllers and testing them in provided environment (like a
            'game' of sorts) - to learn how, 
            <a href="#/gs_ai">head to our quick start guide</a>, but no one will stop you from playing around with built-in
            controllers first! We've included some pretty simple and popular solutions for you to observe, test and - ultimately
            - to base your own controllers on.</p>
            <p>The package you download provides you with 3 basic options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Launch FRAIL and enjoy built-in map scenarios</li>
                <li>Modify supported maps with our Blender plugin (requires 
                    <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender's Foundation Blender</a>) - 
                    <a href="#/gs_blender">click here to learn how</a></li>
                <li>Write you own AI controller compatibile with FRAIL framework and test it in our environment (requires code
                    compilation)</li>
            </ul>
