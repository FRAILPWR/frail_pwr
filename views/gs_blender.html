                <h2 id="1">1. Requirements & Preparations</h2>
                <p>First, make sure that you have appropriate Blender version installed. Due to frequent API changes, our plugin is
                only guaranteed to work on 
                <b>Blender's Foundation Blender 2.68</b></p>
                <p>Then, you should copy blender plugin script into your installation's 
                <code>addons</code> directory (by default, it's in 
                <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.68\scripts\addons</code>). Go ahead and copy the 
                <code>FRAIL_IMPORT</code> directory.</p>
                <p>The result should look somewhat like this (depending on different plugins you may have installed before):</p>
                <img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderaddons.png" />
                <p>You're all set!</p>
                <p>If all went well, it's time to open Blender. Skip the opening panel and go straight into User preferences pane.
                You should be presented with view like this:</p>
                <img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderuserpreferences.png" width="100%" />
                <p>Type "frail" into the search box and check the only option into "activated" mode.</p>
                <img src="images/tut_blender/blenderactivated.png" width="100%" />
                <h2 id="2">2. Importing a map</h2>
                <p>Now, locate "Info" section in one of the panels (Blender's layout may be confusing when you see it for
                the first time, yeah) and choose 
                <code>File- > Import -> FRAIL map file (.json)</code></p>
                <img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderimport.png" width="50%" />
                <p>Next, navigate to 
                <code>mod_levels</code> directory (
                <code>frail_pwr\build\data\mod_levels</code>) and choose map desired for moding. Import it!</p>
                <p>
                <strong>Caution: it will take... some time. Lots of time, actually, especially with arena_a. Just wait patiently. You
                    may open developer console ( 
                    <code>Window -> Toggle system console</code>) if you want to stay informed of what's going on in the
                    background.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>When the map finishes importing you're all set! Well, almost.</p>
                <img src="images/tut_blender/blendermapa.png" width="100%" />
                <p>Press 
                <b>N</b> and in "Display" section check the "Textured Solid" option</p>
                <p>You're all set!</p>
                <img src="images/tut_blender/blendermapb.png" width="100%" />
                <h2 id="3">3. Playing around</h2>
                <p>For the time being, you are only permitted to 
                <b>repositioning</b> and 
                <b>deleting</b> object from map. Sorry! Upgrade is on the way.</p>
                <p>Try it out yourself! Move that pesky lava lake to a middle of the map, set the perfect trap for Boss, or align a
                chain of barrels to trap actors in a sea of fire and crowd control. You don't need snares? Remove them
                alogether!</p>
                <img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blendermapmod.png" width="100%" />
                <h2 id="4">4. Saving changes</h2>
                <p>When you're done, proceed to 
                <code>File -> Export -> FRAIL map file (.json)</code></p>
                <img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderexport.png" width="50%" />
                <p>Navigate do 
                <code>levels</code> directory (sic!). You'll find it in 
                <code>frail_pwr/build/data/levels</code>. Save under desired name. Note that plugin will automatically add a
                "_mod" suffix to your choosen name</p>
                <img class="featuredImg" src="images/tut_blender/blenderexportout.png" width="100%" />
                <p>Click "Export FRAIL .json map file", and you're all set!</p>
                <h2 id="5">5. Nota bene</h2>
                <p>1. Don't try to import another map directly after exporing current one. Blender has... issues with removing
                meshes.</p>
                <p>2. When in doubt, don't be afraid to take a look in the developer console 
                <code>Window -> Toggle system console</code> to learn what went wrong</p>
                <p>3. While adding is not yet supported, .obj files for all game objects are available in 
                <code>frail_pwr/build/data/mod_levels/game_objects</code> . You may try importing one manually to set its location
                wherever you please, and manually modyfying .json map file later, adding a fitting entry.</p></div>
